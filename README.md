# Predicting-Coronary-Heart-Disease

# Accuracy Comparison of ML-Classifier for Coronary Heart Disease Detection

# Background

Coronary heart disease occurs when there is a buildup of plaque in one of the coronary arteries which reduces blood flow. A dataset from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation was used from the UCI Machine Learning repository which holds a list of medical attributes and whether or not coronary disease was found for 303 patients.

# Objective
The goal is to create a tool based on this dataset to determine whether or not a patient has coronary heart disease

# Classifiers
Neural Network
Random Forest
Decision Tree
SVM
Naives Bayes
Python Libs
NumPy
Pandas
SciPy
Matplotlib
Jupyter
Scikit-learn (the library that we will use later in this post when creating the predictive models)

# Prerequisite
Python >= v3.8
Jupyter Notebook
Some knowledge of Machine Learning
